# ASP.NET Validation Controls

Whenever we design a form where we take input from user there may be a chance that we may not get correct information. So we can go for Validation controls in order to put some validations on the client side.

- Validation controls validates the user input data to ensure that useless, unauthenticated, or contradictory data don't get stored.

**Validation Controls are:**

1. ######  Required Field Validator

2. ###### Range Validator

3. ###### Compare Validator

4. ###### Regular Expression

5. ###### Custom Validator

6. ###### Validation Summary 


1.  Required Field Validator: Required Field Validator control is used to make the input field a required field in the application. The control raises an error if the input value is not entered by the user.
2. Range Validator: The Range Validator control is used to check that the user enters an input between two values. User can check between numbers, dates and characters.
3. Compare Validator: The Compare Validator is used to compare the values of one input control to the another input control or to a fixed value. If the input control value is empty then no validation occurs.
4. Regular Expression: The Regular Expression validator control is used to ensure that an input value matches a specifies pattern. It is useful for checking email address, phone numbers, zip codes, etc. The validation will not fail is the input control is empty.
5. Custom Validator: The custom validator allows the user to write a method to handle the validation of the value entered. It is used to compare the users input to a value in the database or the arithmetic validations for the controls.
6. Validation Summary: The Validation Summary control is used to display the summary of all validation errors in a web page.
