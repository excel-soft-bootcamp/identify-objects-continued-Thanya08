## Cache<br>
Caching is a technique of storing frequently used data/information in memory, so that, when the same data/information is needed next time, it could be directly retrieved from the memory instead of being generated by the application.<br>
Types of Caching:
   1) Output Caching
   2) Fragment Caching
   3) Data Caching <br/>
- Output caching:<br>
 Output cache stores a copy of the finally rendered HTML pages or part of pages sent to the client. When the next client requests for this page, instead of regenerating the page, a cached copy of the page is sent, thus saving time.<br>
<%@ OutputCache Duration = "10" VaryByParam = "None" %> <br>
- Fragment Caching:<br>
In some scenarios we only need to cache only a segment of a page. For example a contact us page in a main page will be the same for all the users and for that there is no need to cache the entire page.
