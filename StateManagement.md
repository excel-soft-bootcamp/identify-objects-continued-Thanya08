State Management Types:

1 .Client-Side State Management       2. Server-Side State Management

1.Client-Side State Management :-The state related information will directly get stored on the Client side.That specific information will travel back and communicate with every request
generated by the user then afterwards provides responses after Server-side communication.
Client-side state management techniques are:-
- View state:In general we can say it is used for storing user data in ASP.NET, sometimes in ASP.NET applications the user wants to maintain or store their data temporarily after a post-back.. In this case VIEW STATE is the most used and preferred way of doing that.
 
- Hidden field :A hidden field is used for storing small amounts of data on the client side. In most simple words it's just a container of some objects but their result is not rendered on our web browser. It is invisible in the browser.

- Cookies: A set of Cookies is a small text file that is stored in the user's hard drive using the client's browser. Cookies are just used for the sake of the user's identity matching as it only stores information such as sessions id's, some frequent navigation or post-back request objects.
- Persistent Cookie
 
Cookies having an expiration date is called a persistent cookie. This type of cookie reaches their end as their expiration dates comes to an end. In this cookie we set an expiration date.
- Non-Persistent Cookie
 
Non-persistent types of cookies aren't stored in the client's hard drive permanently. It maintains user information as long as the user access or uses the services. Its simply the opposite procedure of a persistent cookie.

- Control State: Control state is based on the custom control option. For expected results from CONTROL STATE we need to enable the property of view state. 

- Query strings: Query strings are used for some specific purpose. These in a general case are used for holding some value from a different page and move these values to the different page. The information stored in it can be easily navigated to one page to another or to the same page as well.

2.Server-Side State Management :- Server-Side State Management is different from Client-side State Management but the operations and working is somewhat the same in functionality.
In Server-Side State Management all the information is stored in the user memory.Due to this functionality there is more secure domains at the server side in comparision to 
Client-side state management.
Server-Side State Management techniques are:

 - Session State: Session is one of the most common way which is being used by developers to maintain the state of the application. The Session basically stores the values as a dictionary collection in key/value pairs. It completely utilizes server resources to store the data. It is a secure way of storing data, since the data will never be passed to the client.
   * In-proc
   * State Server
   * SQL Server
   
 - Application State :If the information that we want to be accessed or stored globally throughout the application, even if multiple users access the site or application at the same time, then we can use an Application Object for such purposes.
It stores information as a Dictionary Collection in key - value pairs. This value is accessible across the pages of the application / website.
There are 3 events of the Application which are as follows

-Application_Start
-Application_Error
-Application_End
